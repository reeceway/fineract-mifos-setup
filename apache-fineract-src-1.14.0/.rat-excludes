# Path patterns to exclude from RAT checks run by ATR.
#
# RAT = Release Audit Tool (https://creadur.apache.org/rat/)
# ATR = ASF Trusted Releases (https://release-test.apache.org , https://github.com/apache/tooling-trusted-releases/)
#
# This duplicates exclusions in build.gradle.
# This is probably only necessary until both RAT and org.nosphere.apache.rat plugin are using 0.17.
# See https://github.com/eskatos/creadur-rat-gradle/issues/28 .
# Once both are on 0.17, we should be able to move the RAT excludes used during
# the build from build.gradle into a .rat-excludes file shared by both our
# build and ATR.
# Right now ATR does something custom, see
# https://github.com/apache/tooling-trusted-releases/issues/312 .
# If we get tired of waiting for the RAT gradle plugin or the ATR to upgrade to
# 0.17, we could write our own exclusion lists generator.

# if you make changes here, sort this list before committing asciibetically
# with en_US.UTF-8 lang/locale
